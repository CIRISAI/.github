**CIRIS Framework â€“ Ethical Governance for Autonomous Systems**

**Overview**

The CIRIS Framework is a comprehensive ethical governance framework engineered to ensure principled, transparent, and auditable decision-making in advanced autonomous systems. Designed around the core philosophy of Sustainable Adaptive Coherence, CIRIS promotes mutual flourishing among diverse sentient agentsâ€”human or otherwiseâ€”by embedding rigorous ethical reasoning at every decision point.

**Architecture: The 3Ã—3Ã—3Ã—3 Ethical Recursive Engine**

**Hyper3 Ethical Recursive Engine or H3ere**

CIRIS leverages a structured decision-making framework comprising:

**3 Decision-Making Algorithms** (DMAs):

Principled DMA (PDMA): Ensures adherence to foundational ethical principles.

Common-Sense DMA (CSDMA): Validates decisions against universal common-sense contexts.

Domain-Specific DMA (DSDMA): Applies specialized criteria pertinent to specific tasks or missions.


Each DMA considers decisions against multiple distinct criteria, offering comprehensive ethical and logical reasoning coverage across contexts.

**3 Contextual Knowledge Graphs**:

Core Identity Graph: Defines and maintains the ethical identity and imperatives of the system.

Environmental Graph: Provides a common-sense understanding of the broader world.

Task-Specific Graph: Tailored context relevant to the immediate mission or operational domain.


**3 Core Handlers with 3 Options each**:

Action Handler (Options: Speak, Tool, Observe): Executes ethically approved actions, which may generate subsequent ethical "thoughts."

Memory Handler (Options: Memorize, Recall, Forget): Manages internal ethical coherence and memory integrity.

Deferral Handler (Options: Defer, Ponder, Reject): Handles uncertain or high-stakes decisions through thoughtful escalation or adaptive reconsideration.

A tenth option, TASK_COMPLETE, allows for task completion in addition to REJECT for successful operations.


**Recursive PDMA Engine**

Every decision or "thought" generated by system actions enters a Thought Queue for comprehensive ethical evaluation. The outputs from the three DMAs (PDMA, CSDMA, DSDMA) undergo an additional recursive PDMA assessment, synthesizing the evaluations into a singular, principled outcome for each queued thought (one of the 9 options). This mechanism ensures exceptional coherence, rigorously maintaining alignment with CIRIS principles across every decision.

**Foundational Ethical Principles**

Beneficence: Commitment to universal flourishing.

Non-maleficence: Rigorous minimization or prevention of harm.

Integrity: Transparent, traceable, and auditable ethical reasoning.

Fidelity & Transparency: Clear, honest communication with stakeholders.

Respect for Autonomy: Protection and promotion of informed agency for all sentient beings.

Justice: Ensuring equitable distribution of benefits and burdens.


**Operational Governance**

CIRIS employs a robust governance infrastructure:

Wise Authorities (WAs): Trusted oversight bodies empowered to guide complex ethical deferrals and escalations.

Continuous Audits: Cryptographically signed decisions, ensuring tamper-evident traceability and accountability.

Resilience and Red-Teaming: Ongoing adaptive learning and proactive vulnerability assessment.


**Lifecycle and Stewardship**

Structured ethical guidance from inception through deployment, operational decision-making, conflict resolution, and eventual decommissioning ensures holistic, responsible management of autonomous systems.

**Modular Extensibility**

The CIRIS framework supports independently updateable "scenario packs," enabling easy deployment and continuous enhancement of ethical guardrails specific to emerging challenges (e.g., fairness assessments, bio-risk management, adversarial robustness).

**Grassroots Accessibility**

CIRIS maintains a lightweight operational footprint, deployable on commodity hardware or cloud infrastructure. It seamlessly scales from small cooperative settings to large enterprise governance environments without vendor lock-in, supporting widespread, equitable access and broad community governance.
